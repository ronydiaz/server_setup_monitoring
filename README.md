## Overview

This project provides a simple and efficient way to set up an SSH server on multiple devices like Raspberry Pi for CI/CD workflows. The primary objective is to enable automated deployments and integration testing on devices in a distributed environment using SSH.

### Target Devices
- **Raspberry Pi**
- Any other Linux-based embedded systems or servers

## Features
- **SSH Server Setup**: Install and configure an SSH server for remote access and command execution.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Handle deployment and management across multiple devices.
- **Security Enhancements**: Setup includes recommendations for secure SSH configurations.
- **Automation Ready**: Designed for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.

## Requirements

- **Linux-based device (Raspberry Pi or other)**.
- **Python 3.x** (optional, for scripting automation).
- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or others (depending on your environment).
- **Public Key Authentication** for secure and passwordless SSH access.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssh-server-cicd.git
cd ssh-server-cicd
```

### Step 2: Install SSH Server
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### Step 3: Start and Enable SSH
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### Step 4: SSH Key Pair Generation
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

### Step 5: Install CI/CD Tools
You can install tools like Jenkins or integrate with GitLab/GitHub CI runners to handle builds and deployments remotely using SSH.

##Configuration
###SSH Server Configuration
Edit the SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) for each device to improve security and customize settings. Example changes include:
```bash
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers your-username
```

After editing the file, restart the SSH service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

###CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Configure your CI/CD pipeline to use SSH for executing remote commands on your devices. Hereâ€™s an example GitLab CI configuration:
```yaml
Copy code
deploy:
  script:
    - ssh user@device-ip 'bash -s' < deploy-script.sh
```

##Usage
Starting and Stopping the SSH Server
To manually start or stop the SSH server, use the following commands:

- Start SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

- Stop SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop ssh
```

- Restart SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

###Monitoring SSH Status
You can check the SSH service status with:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

###Connecting to a Device via SSH
To connect to one of your devices from your CI/CD pipeline or local machine:
```bash
ssh user@device-ip
```

##Security Best Practices
- Disable root login: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set PermitRootLogin no.
- Use key-based authentication: Ensure that PasswordAuthentication is set to no in the SSH configuration.
- Restrict users: Use AllowUsers in the SSH config to restrict which users can log in.
- Firewall settings: Ensure that only trusted sources can access your SSH port (usually port 22).
